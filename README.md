# Cutting-edge web scraping techniques

This one hour workshop will be presented at [NICAR 2025](https://www.ire.org/training/conferences/nicar-2025/) on Saturday March 8th from 11:30am to 12:30pm in Gray's Bay, 8th floor.

> Interested in new and effective advanced web scraping techniques? Join this session to learn about:
>
> - Video scraping: a new technique where you take a screen capture video and feed it into Google's Gemini models to turn it into structured data.
> - Using image models such as Gemini, GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet are also extremely effective. It's possible to extract structured data from images, or poorly structured PDF files
> - Other modern scraping techniques using libraries like Playwright - a modern alternative to Selenium - for browser automation. Browser automation becomes a lot less complicated if you combine it with video or image analysis models.
>
> This session is good for: journalists with some web scraping experience. Attendees will need to bring their own laptop (no tablets).
